## ❓ Why the name VoyaStay?

**VoyaStay** is a blend of the words **"voyage"** (meaning a journey or travel) and **"stay"** (a place to rest or lodge). The name reflects the platform’s mission: helping travelers find unique and memorable places to stay on their journeys. It’s modern, easy to remember, and perfectly captures the spirit of adventure and comfort that the site offers.
